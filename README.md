## Project Description

**Project Goal:** 
To analyze and understand MonkeyPox case trends in European Union countries.

**Datasets:** 
Two datasets were utilized in this project:
1. [Dataset 1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00001/default/table?lang=en): Population data of the European countries under study.
2. [Dataset 2](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-monkeypox-cases-eueea): Number of Monkeypox cases in the EU/EEA for May, June, and July 2022.

**Key Project Steps:**
- Merged the two datasets based on their relationships.
- Explored MonkeyPox cases for each country.
- Categorized MonkeyPox cases into five distinct categories for improved visualization.
- Created a butterfly chart to showcase the number of cases and population for each country.
- Calculated the incidence rate per 100,000 population.
- Included separate pages for each month (May, June, and July) to visualize the number of cases.
- Integrated a map displaying the country name, number of cases, and population count with additional information available through hover interactions, such as the rank of confirmed cases (descending) and the respective month.

## Observations:
* Fewer MonkeyPox cases were reported in May 2022 compared to June and July of the same year.
* Spain had the highest incidence rate of 5.22 cases per 100,000 population.
* Slovakia recorded the lowest incidence rate at 0.02 cases per 100,000 population.

## Project Needs
- Data exploration and descriptive statistics.
